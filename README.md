# Tsukistar's International Website

Tsukistar's new international personal website is developed using Vue 3 and incorporates many new features I've never tried before, such as multilingual support, custom dialog, page transition animations, smooth scrolling, image preloading, and more.

In the near future, it will be made responsive, ensuring optimal browsing experiences across mobile devices and PCs. Additionally, I plan to introduce state management such as pinia to optimize the existing codebase.
